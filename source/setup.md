# Codon Setup 

The paths mostly used by Rfam on the codon cluster are: 

- software packages 
  
```/hps/software/users/agb/rfam```

- production data
  
```/nfs/production/agb/rfam```

- release FTP data

``` /nfs/ftp/public/databases/Rfam/ ```

- website code, html reports generated by rfreport 
- must be on a datamover node to access
- currently this info is mounted from (old) noah to the HX web VM
- we need to migrate VM from HX to HL to mount from codon to the preview website

```/nfs/public/rw/xfam/rfam/```


Virtual users: 

- rfamprod
- xfm_adm

# Text search

Data for the text search is stored here `/nfs/production/agb/rfam/search_dumps/current_release`, and is indexed nightly. 

Description of indexed fields: <http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch/metadata.ebi?db=rfam>

The steps to update all data for the text search are run during each release, except for that which runs as part of the PDB pipeline.
